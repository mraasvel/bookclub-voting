# todo

- style admin page: menu selector for current component (create tab, active sessions with cancel, goto etc)
- style vote creation page
- show 'currently winning' in vote listing

- Ability to halt votes you created, expiration date or duration at start of vote (vote can be closed/open)

- API key support (use JWT instead of session => auth token makes more sense in this context)
- orm migration instead of synch

- more types of votes, single choice, top 3, pick 3, scoring, etc
