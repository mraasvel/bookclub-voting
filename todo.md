# todo

- add some router bar to navigate
- style login page
- style voting page
- style vote result page
- style vote creation page
- sort vote result page by total score?

- Bar to navigate from homepage, api docs, votes, reading-list, logout, etc
- Ability to halt votes you created, expiration date or duration at start of vote

- API key support (use JWT instead of session => auth token makes more sense in this context)
- orm migration instead of synch

- timeout or manual cancel for voting (ends at point in time)
