# todo

- style voting page (performing vote)
- style vote result page
- style home, vote listing page
- sort vote result page by total score?
- style admin page: menu selector for current component (create tab, active sessions with cancel, goto etc)
- style vote creation page
- show 'currently winning' in vote listing

- Ability to halt votes you created, expiration date or duration at start of vote

- API key support (use JWT instead of session => auth token makes more sense in this context)
- orm migration instead of synch

- timeout or manual cancel for voting (ends at point in time)
